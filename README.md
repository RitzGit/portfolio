# My Portfolio

My personal portfolio website, currently built using Vue.js

## TODO
- [x] Get the basic grid system working
- [x] Fill everything with content
- [x] Dynamically load content
- [ ] Create a working and resource friendly threejs background that hides on mobile
- [x] Make content mobile responsive
- [ ] Make header mobile responsive
- [ ] Remake as a static site, since vue really isn't needed
